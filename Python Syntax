# create the initial variables below.
#Our first step is to create the variables for each factor we will consider when estimating medical insurance costs.
#These are the variables we will need to create:

#age: age of the individual in years
#sex: 0 for female, 1 for male*
#bmi: individual’s body mass index
#num_of_children: number of children the individual has
#smoker: 0 for a non-smoker, 1 for a smoker
#Create the following variables for a 28-year-old, nonsmoking woman who has three children and a BMI of 26.2.

age = 28

#sex is 0 for female and 1 for male
sex = 0

#smoker is 0 for non and 1 for smoker
smoker = 0

num_of_children = 3

bmi = 26.2


# After the declaration of the variables, create a variable called insurance_cost that utilizes the following formula:
#Add insurance estimate formula below

insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500


#Let’s display this value in an informative way. Print out the following string in the terminal:


print("This person's insurance cost is " + str(insurance_cost) + " dollars.")


#We have seen how our formula can estimate costs for one individual. Now let’s play with some individual factors to see what role each one plays in our estimation!
#Let’s start with the age factor. Using a plus-equal operator, add 4 years to our age variable.

# Age Factor

age += 4



#Now that we have changed our age value, we want to recalculate our insurance cost. Declare a new variable called new_insurance_cost underneath the expression that increased age by 4.
#Make sure you leave the line with the insurance_cost variable the same. We will use it later in our program!

new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500



#Next, we want to find the difference between our new_insurance_cost and insurance_cost. To do this, let’s create a new variable called change_in_insurance_cost and set it equal to the difference between new_insurance_cost and insurance_cost

change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost



# We want to display this information in an informative way similar to the output from instruction 3.
# Doing this will tell us how 4 years in age affects medical insurance cost estimates assuming that all other variables remain the same.

print("The change in cost of insurance after increasing the age by 4 years is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")


#reassigning age to its original value 

age -= 4


# BMI Factor
# On the next line, using the plus-equal operator, add 3.1 to our bmi variable.

bmi += 3.1


# rewrite the insurance cost formula and assign it to the variable name new_insurance_cost.

new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500

change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost

print("The change in estimated insurance cost after increasing BMI by 3.1 is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + "dollars.")


#reassigning age to its original value
#Before we make any additional changes, first reassign your bmi variable back to its original value of 26.2

bmi -= 3.1


# Male vs. Female Factor
# Let’s look at the effect sex has on medical insurance costs. .

# On a new line of code, reassign the value of sex to 1. 
# sex is 0 for female and 1 for male

sex = 1

new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500

change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost

print("The change in estimated cost for being male instead of female is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")


sex = 0

# So far we have looked at 3 of the 5 factors in the insurance costs formula. The two remaining are smoker and num_of_children. If you want to keep challenging yourself, spend some time investigating these factors!
# Rewrite the insurance cost formula and assign it to the variable name new_insurance_cost.
# Save the difference between new_insurance_cost and insurance_cost in a variable called change_in_insurance_cost


#smoking factor:
#smoker is 0 for non and 1 for smoker

smoker = 1

new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500

change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost

print("The change in estimated cost for a smoker  is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")



# number of children 

num_of_children += 2

new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500

change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost

print("The change in estimated cost for an individual with 5 children is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")
